# vox2ksh

This converts vox files to ksh. If you don't know what those are then this repo is not for you.

## Usage

Put your vox folders in `data`, in the format `vox_<archive number>_ifs`. The filenames should be kept exactly as 
contained within the IFS archive.

Once you have that set up, run `converter.py` with the `-c` arg set to one of the testcases in `CASES`.
